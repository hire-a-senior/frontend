# Frontend

## Running the application

1. Download the code.
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run in the development mode: `npm run dev`

## Development

1. Update the project to the latest version: `git pull`
2. Select an issue from the `issues` tab. Let everyone know you are working on this issue, add a comment to the issue and you will be assigned.
3. Switch to develop branch.: `git checkout develop`
4. Create a new branch for this issue: `git checkout -b <issue-id>-<short-description>`
5. After you are done with the task, send the changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "<issue-id>: <A short meaningful description>"
git push -u origin <branch-name>
```

After successfully pushed the changes to the issue branch, open a pull request from the new branch to `develop` branch. Optionally add a reviewer(for now @Mert18). That's it.
